# Diversity is our greatest advantageous hit

Decades of research have proved that diversity is a powerful force that can foster a strong corporate culture and increase profits in the long run. In addition, a diversity of skills can translate to advantages in all spheres of society*.

For example, for our software, having ; a feet in pixel-art and painting as part of a hobby or even for education, and having the other one in the sphere that encompass privacy cares, decentralized finance, nuclear-proof storage assistance of visual content (enabled by blockchain technology and our low-weight NFTs that scales-up in intelligent ways) makes us strong and resilient, it is currently building a community with diverse minds, diverse culture, diverse age, and so on… It is even used in schools! Also, people from all around the diverse continent and countries we have on earth use it for fun but also to earn something such as a glory of an artwork or a little incentivize within the cryptocurrency market that is called NFTs.

# We have 100% transparent activities

It might be impossible to find an organization today that doesn’t benefit in some way from open source software. Some companies, like Intel, IBM, and Samsung, have entire open source programs devoted to contributing to open source communities. Other companies are commercially dependent on open source software that is critical to the success of the company, so it becomes advantageous (and necessary) to contribute to open source software projects.*

Mostly in the wild way and to say, companies betting on open-source aren’t obviously transparent about their financial activities, and this is completely fine if they manage to benefits from the other side of their activities to which can funds the free and source-visible systems that they build!

Yes but, for our companies as we aren’t tied to affiliate marketing or selling analytics data to tiers, we have chosen to run on donations also known as grants from top business class companies that directly or indirectly benefits from the advantageous further way of creating art we’ve built, and all that they decide to gives to Pixa.Pics’ is visible on a platform named OpenCollective.

It provide us a fiscal host with 100% transparency of incomes and expense meanwhile it is just like our source-code, the website is hosted on the main GitHub branch of where every lines of code are visible to anyone to verify and take advantages of our new ideas and concrete solution within the web software development domain.

How can you be a more open, accessible, and transparent?

# Feedback easily being open means yield

Everyone wants to have their voices heard, and collecting feedback allows just that. This is a win-win situation for both us and our “customers”. The feedback gained from users helps to improve the product we develop while also helping them feel that they have a say in shaping your product or service and that’s why we’re keen on being more than open-source but also receptive and alert to what our strong net of diverse users have felt as needs of improvements.

Community engagement is a key within the greatest principle of decentralized governance (no not misleadingly think it is distributed, it stays hierarchic but more flexible and less pyramidal, …) which is in the field of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous organization) THE “hit on the target of success” to run an organization with communities and their engagement making the machine running like a well-greased high-performance steam engine, with all the necessary force to pull the wagon of research, development, and communications, as ideas flow from communities to platforms (just like solutions) and rails up toward the road-map we can assess to be the resilient path to a long-term wanted solution and success.

Within Education, NFTs (crypto) and Digital Art, We simply make potential possible!
