# PIXA.PICS 

LET'S SAY : You can do selfies to pixel art back to HD image (as a painting) very easily! #NFTs #ARTWORK #ANON #NOCOPYLEFT

 * Shift copyright to left (as it recreate a drawing from an image it removes it).
 * Anonymize selfies (keep details masked).
 * Compress a visual scene into less than 16 Kb PNGs that scales HD.
 * Do more, without less... This is pixaaaaa! (pics)

## Tomorrow is knocking!

Pixa.Pics stands in favor of the freedom of expression, communication, education; **respect for the privacy of citizens and civil rights in general**. We defend the free flow of ideas, knowledge and culture as the software is completely free and open-source. 

> IT CLAIMS TO BE THE UNBREAKABLE, UNCHANGABLE, UNSTOPPABLE Ace of Automatic Information; Blockchain is a list of transactions grouped into multiple blocks that constitute a state in a machine that changes according to a cryptography-based agreement AND between its participating terminals through a data network. This technology allows you to save and keep a structured data set for centuries flawlessly.

As a team we have a commitment to work collaboratively, and participate with maximum transparency and thus lastly, we also supports free speech, anti-corruption and net neutrality facing it with **the swords of code we are forging to improve the third webâ€™s major update.**

## What does it performs?

 > This is PIXAAAAA! An awesome pixel art editor made with material design guideline trends and awesome web technologies! 100% visionary in privacy concerns/critics and against detractors with its development that has enabled to show an online-self (image) within a minimalistic version of an high definition image (minima-art), to which, looks like pixel art throughout an automatic resize and color quantization, and then to up-scale it way beyond Full HD through an algorithm that makes it happens to make it looking like a painting, while it will generate an infinite SVG and 6x bigger PNG version of the minima-art.

 * **Protect images.**
 * **Sanitizing private data before processing it remotely.**
 * **Staying on the front line of dropping cost as it is a FOSS.**
 * **Getting to openly fight what misses being just great, while boring good exists.** 
 * **Staying modern without paying anything for useless and toxic ultra-simplification tools.**

> The use of social networking sites should be governed by the same principles as use of the Internet in general. As little personal information as possible should be divulged. The information should be well protected and only made accessible to clearly defined persons. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with each individual Internet user. Prior to publication, everyone should think and decide for themselves which personal data to publish on the Internet, thereby making it available to the public for an indeterminate time period.  â€” Semi-annual report of 2008, *Federal Strategic Unit for IT (FSUIT) - Federal Office of Police fedpol (Swiss Confederation). ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­*

We strongly believe bold the following recklessly for a while. The Internet has become an oligopoly Disneyland with little innovation. The central banks have corrupted money - the operating system of society. We see blockchain as a new computing platform with novel features, that could both, bring a new phase of innovation, and redefine the existing monetary systems. We want to contribute to bringing a better future sooner. Hence, ten months ago, we founded pixa pics.

> And so, when we talk about privacy and anonymity or pecuniary freedom, it wouldn't occur to some that non-fungible tokens are a good reason to think that.

Look! On the STEEM blockchain you can post base64 text, transactions are rigged to 73Kb at maxima but STEEM is now kinda old for a blockchain.

## Getting further with development

**Great is this king, the king kills that is good, you can't kill what is good, but you can kill the king!**
The king is the newest being an amount of funds along with some specifications to create a new feature that kill one.

**SO :**

Always while a new checkpoint is set the king, once it lived only then, it can be redefined, and kills that you want that isn't great once finished yet good as it was; Example 1000$ for performance improvement development next set a new king as a checkpoint to kills the good rendering system not enabling to run it well in Africa and Europe (But that is done, it is running well even on an old smartphone, yeah!).

**NOW:**

> The king is empty and is not set to achieve anything, currently when it catch a new one, let it hit that is good and will be replaced by a motiated idea accepted and pushed with funds important enough for achievement of the task.

**Current ideas seeking funds:**

- Undefined

**Queued ideas seeking funds:**

* Translate the app in : [EN, FR, DE, IT, ID, PT, JA, ZH, RU, KO, HI, ES]
* Make code clear and well documented.
* Rebuild some functionalities again.
* Audit what users need and list the ideas found.

## Get started and fund a king functionality now
