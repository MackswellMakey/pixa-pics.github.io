You can easily multiply that it doesn't cost anyone much to share a simple details-less pictures on the fly even on a blockchain.

# About Me

Passionate about stars, cryptography, and computer, I am vigilant to care about details and building https://pixa.pics wasn't a detail, it was a long road made of code.
