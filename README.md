# PIXA.PICS 


Light data reduced throughout crystal mathemagick functions of our NFTs laboratory as a great pixel art editor just as any others and super-functionalities enhanced for NFTs proves that "Luck" for success editing NFTs and artworks with few pixels really equals that we determined for you into https://pixe.pics, it is no chaos but choice best thought and hard work side that has let no details for all man and pleasing eyes!

Join the great art we like adventure  NOW! NFTs around 14Kb, easily render 6x fancy and 24x very sharp creation you'll love to give it a try? It is thanks to our contributors including our sponsors supports that give use of which to stays wise and vigilant in being leaders of NFTs laboratory all around the crypto hype.

Also join us, for tomorrow and beyond, in the web app for pixel art, thanks to yesterday and therefore right now, pixel by pixel, layers by layers, and creative adventures by creative state of existence, but also in real-life, ideas by flow, and willpower by progression thanks to that is shared by success and intentions that you got just now, an enhanced way to achieve, and reclaim it once and for a while even offline on here the cheapest smartphone (Like mine of 2017 nowadays sold anytime in the now for 100$) and tomorrow the most advanced end device giving a full we access to web technologies.

## Tomorrow is knocking!

Pixa Pics stands in favor of the freedom of expression, communication, education; **respect for the privacy of citizens and civil rights in general**. We defend the free flow of ideas, knowledge and culture as the software is completely free and open-source. 

As a team we have a commitment to work collaboratively, and participate with maximum transparency and thus lastly, we also supports free speech, anti-corruption and net neutrality facing it with **the swords of code we are forging to improve the third webâ€™s major update.**

## What does it performs?


 > This is PIXAAAAA! An awesome pixel art editor made with material design guideline trends and awesome web technologies! 100% visionary in privacy concerns/critics and against detractors with its development that has enabled to show an online-self (image) within a minimalistic version of an high definition image (minima-art), to which, looks like pixel art throughout an automatic resize and color quantization, and then to up-scale it way beyond Full HD through an algorithm that makes it happens to make it looking like a painting, while it will generate an infinite SVG and 6x bigger PNG version of the minima-art.

 * **Protect images.**
 * **Sanitizing private data before processing it remotely.**
 * **Staying on the front line of dropping cost as it is a FOSS.**
 * **Getting to openly fight what misses being just great, while boring good exists.** 
 * **Staying modern without paying anything for useless and toxic ultra-simplification tools.**

We strongly believe bold the following recklessly for a while. The Internet has become an oligopoly Disneyland with little innovation. The central banks have corrupted money - the operating system of society. We see blockchain as a new computing platform with novel features, that could both, bring a new phase of innovation, and redefine the existing monetary systems. We want to contribute to bringing a better future sooner. Hence, ten months ago, we founded pixa pics.

> And so, when we talk about privacy and anonymity or pecuniary freedom, it wouldn't occur to some that non-fungible tokens are a good reason to think that.

Look! On the STEEM blockchain you can post base64 text, transactions are rigged to 73Kb at maxima but STEEM is now kinda old for a blockchain.

# How can it work thanks to sponsorship?

> Potential proves potentials true and just like nuclear technologies, simply not devlish, is a joke, which is certainly not a crime even in a war time, because asking question, at pixa pics we never don't cause we could be defined saviour of something, and that has done the next something guess what?
 
>A bit more fun in IT, requires online universe getting greater while that isn't up to you to requires thinking that, well does our supports requires it to ask you when it catch you that?

> The great of Pixa Pics the ennemy of good, whatever and whenever good just shifted apart went below with it before, unwait is up to you to let it hit them not the funniest, rightly by you, asks you, what does it will that is good and should be shifted away.

> Then you enables the things you want to emerge, and that in the origins and now, we, enabled by some few wise, no force at all, just their means that gived, makes it happens what they we wished we ensured followed that is we are:

> SPONSORS SUPPORT PIXA.PICS running forward the fridge non-empty as even the fridge programmer needs his child getting adorable at running a pixel art at will that could need those other developers to have access to cutting edge techs mastered on earth for everyone and for ISS in order to draw that they ate while AND getting more free time at processing time minutely before doing the same on their machine anytime, anywhere before they got a fridge doing it alone, RIGHT THERE, immediately and IN THE NOW staying more human whatever the business cares what is perishing and not eaten in ISS because now one is doing open-sources that steam ahead it's best with sufficiency to not show code more boring that what just stays good and better for now but also to have the power in the veins reading and testing web browser, what they improved just needing going forward reasonably with fun in abundance enabling us to not read them necessarily because they've achieved way back already what they are writing for today and tomorrow while getting extra deception no ones funds ANYONE MOVING possibilities to have FUNIER SHIFTING OF FUN to be GREAT.**.

# Getting further, in the height of the hill, with the king that owns a while greater.

**Great is this king, the king kills that is good, you can't kill what is good but you can kill the king!**

**SO :**

Always a new checkpoint is set the king, once it lived only then, it can be redefined, and kills that you want that isn't great once finished yet good as it was; Example 1000$ of performanced development next set a new king checkpoint to kills the non-existence of any possibilities to run it uqualy in Africa and Europ (But that is done, yeah!).

**NOW:**

> The king is empty and is not set to achieve anything, currently when it catch a new one, let it hit that is good and will be replaced by a motiated idea accepted and pushed with funds important enough for achievement of the task.

INFINITE POSITIVE RESULTS TO ANYONE TRYING ADDING THINGS POSITIVE WHILE IT CAN BE SEEN AND WHY AT BEST FOR IT!

 * THANKS Works to work the next one once you achieved trying your duty in that is code and should matter...
 * THANKS Funds to get back to our pool staying it for new idea for it that of which doesn't negate better builds/wishes/ideas to not go in paradise with your failure nevertheless not coming back of that is void as truth dictate.
 * THANKS Paradise letting money here and keeping anything for eternity as needed and until sometimes if it could being what just should get fine to try again.
 * THANKS Matters getting yourself over yourself as fast as it can and as much as it takes naturally like it just does like not Satan but the inverse, with control optionally and questions all to themselves to solves anything defined or not.
