# Computer’s art, Crypto, and Surveillance.

# About Me

Passionate about stars, cryptography, and computer, I began following a particular interest in 2D/3D visual effects when I was in school to then study some years IT in an organization of public interest where I had to learn Web, Networking, and others useful pieces of stuff I used to develop projects in the field of blockchain technology with the help of my family including my father and my friends.
Philosophy is the science of estimating value, but technology is the value of estimating science. All that we perform in IT is described for humans and encoded for a machine, compassion, and vigilance are required to code along with knowledge.
-Affolter Matias
