And let's say in the years 1980s a computer to play video games wasn't that much as cheap as my android smartphone of an old series.
The phone to which it has been tested is nowadays sold at $100 unused it was dozen of times that price to do the same graphics that time.
You can easily multiply that it doesn't cost anyone much to share a simple details-less pictures on the fly even on a blockchain.

# Tools

All the screenshot has been captured using a "Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017)" having 2gb of ram.
Thus, the project aims to make some advance for the domain of artistic intellect and in it.
With the power that it should be accessible for all, a smartphone for 100$ fits for creating crazy things!
