# The challenges of first-class active protection for the preservation of identity

**What was foreseen by the agent of public order and general justice in 2008 in Switzerland against chaos and negativity regarding Internet potential about one's image.** 

> The use of social networking sites should be governed by the same principles as use of the Internet in general. As little personal information as possible should be divulged. The information should be well protected and only made accessible to clearly defined persons. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with each individual Internet user. Prior to publication, everyone should think and decide for themselves which personal data to publish on the Internet, thereby making it available to the public for an indeterminate time period.  â€” Semi-annual report of 2008, *Federal Strategic Unit for IT (FSUIT) - Federal Office of Police fedpol (Swiss Confederation). ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­*

**Very interesting for pixa.pics as truth forcefully let it being so representing it again, one hating crime before any will to show supports of any laws without fair questioning doing unrighteousness changes on other people's life and true will.**

# The benefits of transparency and integrity of shared knowledge

 * **Protect images.**
 * **Sanitizing private data before processing it remotely.**
 * **Staying on the front line of dropping cost as it is a FOSS.**
 * **Getting to openly fight what misses being just great, while boring good exists.** 
 * **Staying modern without paying anything for useless and toxic ultra-simplification tools.**

Look! On the STEEM blockchain you can post base64 text, transactions are rigged to 73Kb at maxima but STEEM is now kinda old for a blockchain.

# 99 / 100 of performance (Lighthouse desktop metrics)

> 1.0-2.0 seconds in average, is the necessary time to get the content displayed on desktop (Chrome) for the first website's visit after an update of the application which is automatically done within those small 1690ms and prolongated in background for about 8 seconds, then it is more than twice as fast and doesn't require any form of connection to the Internet since assets are stored in the browser cache until the need to update them is comming into matter.

And let's say in the years 1980s a computer to play video games wasn't that much as cheap as my android smartphone of an old series.
The phone to which it has been tested is nowadays sold at $100 unused it was dozen of times that price to do the same graphics that time.
You can easily multiply that it doesn't cost anyone much to share a simple details-less pictures on the fly even on a blockchain.
