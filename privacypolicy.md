# A bit of history ...

WE DIDN'T USE TO STORE ANY OF YOUR DATA OURSELVES ðŸš§ 

**MEANWHILE, IN BOLDS AFFIRMATIONS**, since it doesn't concern, when they are stored, (which is in Switzerland mostly when they get stored), SENSIBLE or PERSONALLY identifiable information (PII) as described by the rule of the law, we can also strongly guarantee that we doesn't need to ask or disclaim. 

We are uniquely free to tell about it with the very systems of feedback we chose to use, simply friendly IMHO.

# Why? We are trusting others too?

The service called "Friendly Analytics" that we make use of, to assist growth and positive change in our product does not store any personally identifiable information (PII) about the website's visitors. "Friendly Analytics" also does not set cookies. that makes the use of [Friendly Analytics](https://friendly.ch/en/) **compliant with data protection laws such as GDPR (EU) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, FADP (Switzerland) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and PECR (California)**. Meanwhile we doesn't store anything else, it stays on your computer, and that's it (even the code can be verified) since we are representing a 100% Free and Open-Source Software being stored and served trough the network by [GitHub Inc](https://github.com/), the platform keeping our code publicly verifiable in the same folder it gets served to minimize risks of any corrupted code from its source of injection.

# What anyone doesn't need to ask us!

As this is the way it gets done, and because we don't store any personal data and don't set any "non-random or anonymous and purely technical cookies", you **wouldn't even need to ever see a "cookie banner" on our project, nor to worrie to have to pass throughout an annoying or not, Consent Management Platform (CMP)** (and this way, as long as we will be able to garantee phisically and legally that we don't use any other tracking tools on the website of PixaPics that can be external to our location or not, that doesn't provide the same security or privacy as we do, at least...

**Let's be clear and technical :**

> We use [Friendly Analytics](https://friendly.ch/analytics) to measure the success and reach of our website. Friendly Analytics is a service of Friendly LLC from Switzerland, which uses **the free open source software Matomo without the processing and storage of personal identifiable information (PII)** and doesn't even need to use cookies. **Information about the type, scope and purpose of data processing can be found** in the [privacy policy of Friendly Analytics](https://friendly.ch/privacy/analytics). Any other data stored on your device from our application functionning aren't exploited illegaly, and as of now, *we could only be legally forced to make you consent to what we shouldn't do and what we should be legally doing IF WE naturally change that decision to get to recieve the duty to having to inform you we're forced to blend over special regulation instead of just having the concern to notify you of the transparancy we make potential **benefits from without limitations but simple powerful warrants**.*

We can also only can be very glad to use only the best companies and passionates which are really proven to be worthy of trust for any of the services the source-code has to rely on from our side of the reachable responsability when it performs what it has been told to do, very simply, either it is by essence about https://cloudflare.com when it anonymise your https://deepai.org colorization and protect our users related to images they might use or even regarding friendly.ch when it is about to trust some sub-processors when it comes to legal and physical warrants of the very respect of the engagement written in their explicative and legal justification regarding it, which is cited bythen below.

> And because we can, we take technical and organizational measures (TOM) to ensure that data is stored securely and protected from unauthorized access just as friendly.ch are involved in doing with our analytics information (starting as of the 9 May 2022 or a bit later) as they have put light on about [here exactly](https://friendly.ch/en/privacy/tom).

 * 1) Simple
 * 2) Private
 * 3) Lightweight
 * 4) Compliant
 * 5) Yours
 * 6) Fair
      
 > While in its current state, for free, for everyone, and forever especially staying, at least not only for today and a bit yesterday, created on "granit" and this way by its contributors and supporters on their own** without being illegal nor asking you dumb or simply annoying questions.
